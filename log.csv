decdb72,Jesse Schollitt,5 hours ago,Added keybinds for the user inputs. Added mouse movement for pitch and roll. Pinned mouse to game window (limits max rotation speeds). Added cockpit overlay.

bbbbba7,Jesse Schollitt,23 hours ago,removed some redundant code and fixed some comments
3f5451f,Jesse Schollitt,23 hours ago,Added ocean. Changed colouring of height map to be more realistic (sand to grass to mountain). Added heightmap fade into ocean. Added get methods in heightmap and skybox to provide positioning of the ocean.
1a8049f,Jesse Schollitt,27 hours ago,commenting for the main added.
75e3443,Jesse Schollitt,30 hours ago,Added complete height offset method to simulate an island land mass (made "edge pinning" redundant so will be removed. Commented out for now). Fixed "dim colours" on non-textured objects that are drawn post-skybox.
6970e7f,Jesse Schollitt,2 days ago,added delta time, sensitivity is quite low for now.

62e5bf6,Jesse Schollitt,2 days ago,Fixed edge faces on first row not being added. Fixed skybox rotating with camera by applying the inverse 4x4 matrix to the skybox and making it very large.

23b102d,Jesse Schollitt,3 days ago,Started on loading .obj file for use as a vehicle for chase camera.
0f03aab,Jesse Schollitt,3 days ago,Camera converted to quat (new class, legacy still included). Fixed screen warping via aspect value in frustum setup. Will replace menu with something decent and fix first offset row of faces not being drawn (if I figure it out).
c68e8f5,Jesse Schollitt,10 days ago,Fixed bug where running the camera.moveForward method in the first loop caused the camera position to be set to non-real numbers.
8a80970,Jesse Schollitt,11 days ago,Playing around with time's effect on camera movement, and allowing changes with time factor removed (bool parameter).
fd31a25,Jesse Schollitt,11 days ago,Not using quat-based camera yet, until I figure out the matrix multiplication. Added colorPointer array and am using it in the render method for the heightmap.
e63253a,Jesse Schollitt,12 days ago,Playing around with quaternion camera instead of euler.
380dac9,Jesse Schollitt,2 weeks ago,Menu finished. Not particularly well done but as a first attempt at making a game menu from scratch, it works. Camera pitch is acting strangely now, so that needs to be fixed. Might as well switch to quaternion-based camera to take advantage of the 4x4 matrix axis rotation.
79b19b1,Jesse Schollitt,2 weeks ago,Menu is now working (values from the menu are used as input parameters in the heightmap class). Bypasses number distribution at the moment to avoid invalid sigma input for distributors that don't use min/max parameters. Fixing it requires changing the min/max fields to mean/sigma fields in the menu (different input types in the arrays). Menu has its own update/render/draw system with separate window events to run the program entirely internally until it is complete.

79db4d9,Jesse Schollitt,2 weeks ago,Added game menu (not fully working but implemented for testing purposes) that will control the vars of the heightmap class prior to its creation. Currently: Escape to close game and menu, Enter to continue passed the menu into the game.
875be65,Jesse Schollitt,2 weeks ago,UI and heightmap are now in their own files with headers. Cleaned up main file of unused vars.

2cee1a8,Jesse Schollitt,3 weeks ago,Slight adjustments to the camera class. The constructor now takes the initial camera position and angle as parameters, and Ascend and Strafe methods have been included to achieve this.
ba46ea9,Jesse Schollitt,3 weeks ago,Changed the square and smoothing methods to check for edges. If on an edge, set value to 0 to avoid gaps in the side of the world when flying out of bounds.
076db25,Jesse Schollitt,3 weeks ago,Overhauled land generation: Fixed the diagonal valley issue, found an optimal random number generator (seeded), Created a smoothing method that can be called multiple times until ideal result is achieved. Fixed starting camera roll to be level (270degree rotation).
d74a3d1,Jesse Schollitt,3 weeks ago,Changed camera operation from glRotate & glTranslate to using Matrix and glLookAt to avoid gimble lock and non-local z-axis camera roll. Camera has been moved to a separate file, with land generation and UI to follow suit.
818f3ca,Jesse Schollitt,3 weeks ago,Initial commit. Wrking versions of height map, camera, and UI. Diamond square needs to be fixed/replaced and possibly switch to bitmap pixel shade values instead of random number generation for vertex z-coords.
